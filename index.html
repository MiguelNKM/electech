                    <h3>Ohm's Law: The Cornerstone of Electrical Theory</h3>
                    <p>Ohm's Law is a fundamental principle in electrical engineering that defines the relationship between voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) in an electrical circuit. This law forms the basis for understanding and analyzing electrical circuits.</p>
                    <p>The formula is expressed as: V = I × R</p>
                    <p>Where:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>V is the voltage across the conductor in volts (V)</li>
                        <li>I is the current flowing through the conductor in amperes (A)</li>
                        <li>R is the resistance of the conductor in ohms (Ω)</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Applications of Ohm's Law:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Circuit Analysis:</strong> Ohm's Law allows engineers to calculate unknown values in a circuit. For example, if you know the voltage and resistance, you can determine the current.</li>

                    <h3>Kirchhoff's Laws: Analyzing Complex Circuits</h3>
                    <p>Kirchhoff's Laws are two fundamental laws in circuit theory that complement Ohm's Law in analyzing more complex circuits:</p>
                    <h4>1. Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL):</h4>
                    <p>KCL states that the sum of currents entering a node is equal to the sum of currents leaving the node. In other words, the algebraic sum of currents in a network of conductors meeting at a point is zero.</p>
                    <p>Mathematically: Σ I<sub>in</sub> = Σ I<sub>out</sub></p>
                    <h4>2. Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL):</h4>
                    <p>KVL states that the sum of all voltages around any closed loop in a circuit must equal zero. This law is based on the principle of conservation of energy.</p>
                    <p>Mathematically: Σ V = 0 (around any closed loop)</p>

                    <h3>Power in Electrical Circuits</h3>
                    <p>Understanding power is crucial in electrical engineering as it relates to energy consumption and efficiency. Power (P) in an electrical circuit is the rate at which energy is transferred or converted. It can be calculated using several formulas:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>P = V × I (Power equals voltage multiplied by current)</li>
                        <li>P = I² × R (Power equals current squared multiplied by resistance)</li>
                        <li>P = V² / R (Power equals voltage squared divided by resistance)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These formulas are derived from Ohm's Law and are invaluable in analyzing circuit performance and energy consumption.</p>

                    <h3>Series and Parallel Circuits: Building Blocks of Complex Systems</h3>
                    <h4>Series Circuits:</h4>
                    <p>In a series circuit, components are connected end-to-end, forming a single path for current flow. Key characteristics include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The current is the same through each component</li>
                        <li>The total voltage is divided among the components</li>
                        <li>The total resistance is the sum of individual resistances: R<sub>total</sub> = R1 + R2 + R3 + ...</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Parallel Circuits:</h4>
                    <p>In a parallel circuit, components are connected across each other, forming multiple paths for current flow. Key characteristics include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The voltage is the same across each component</li>
                        <li>The total current is divided among the components</li>
                        <li>The total resistance is less than the smallest individual resistance: 1/R<sub>total</sub> = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 + ...</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Understanding these basic principles is crucial for any electrical engineer. They form the foundation upon which more complex electrical systems and theories are built. As you progress in your studies, you'll see how these concepts are applied in various fields, from simple household circuits to complex power distribution systems.</p>
